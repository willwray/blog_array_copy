**P1997** is a C++ proposal to make the built-in C array type copyable.

The purpose of this blog is to keep notes as a record of experiences in
implementating P1997 in GCC and Clang compilers.

* What is the proposal, why am I implementing it and blogging the process?

The paper was quietly submitted 20 months ago, then unseen until last month.

It is a modest proposal to make minimal, non-breaking changes.

'Relaxing restrictions' implies that the wording changes required in the
standard document are removals of clauses that explicitly special-case
array type to ban copy operations. simplifies 

## First reading, SG22, August 6th, 2021

The paper was presented to SG22,
the Joint C and C++ Liaison Study Group last month.
The reception was positive (meeting minutes are on the ISO wiki).

The following poll was taken:
>Does SG22 want to forward P1997R1 on to EWG for further refinement?


| SF | F | N | A | SA | Notes |
|----|---|---|---|----|-------|
|1|2|1|0|0|(WG14 consensus)|
|2|4|1|0|0|(WG21 consensus)|

(WG14/WG21 = ISO C/C++ committees, EWG = Evolution Working Group -> C++)

The message from the meeting was "compiler implementations are needed".

Implementation experience is a ‘gating’ requirement for WG14
and a strong recommendation for WG21,
especially in regard to this particular proposal.
